Recommended Refactoring Priority:

✅ Phase 1: Extract Pure Calculation Logic - COMPLETE ✅
   Created: calculation-engine.js
   - ✅ Pure functions with zero DOM dependencies
   - ✅ Exported functions for tax calculations, RMDs, contributions  
   - ✅ Testable mathematical/financial logic
   - ✅ Example: calculateRetirementProjection() as main entry point
   - ✅ Ready for: Unit testing, use in different frameworks
   
   Test Results:
   - ✅ Basic functionality: test-calculation-engine.js (PASSED)
   - ✅ Comprehensive tests: comprehensive-test.js (PASSED)
   - ✅ Performance: 630k+ tax calcs/sec, 324k+ working year calcs/sec
   - ✅ Memory efficient: 0.5KB per calculation
   - ✅ Zero DOM dependencies confirmed

✅ Phase 2: Configuration Object - COMPLETE ✅
   Created: dom-adapter.js, phase2-bridge.js, phase2-demo.js
   - ✅ Configurable DOM element mappings (44 input fields, 21 output elements)
   - ✅ Clean separation of data collection from calculation logic
   - ✅ Framework-agnostic form data collection
   - ✅ Type-safe field access (getNumber, getPercentage, getBoolean, getString)
   - ✅ Centralized DOM configuration (easy to change element IDs)
   - ✅ Legacy compatibility bridge for existing HTML
   
   Test Results:
   - ✅ Phase 2 demo: phase2-demo.js (PASSED)
   - ✅ Integration test: integration-test.js (PASSED) 
   - ✅ Performance: 100 form-to-calc cycles in 1.91ms (0.02ms average)
   - ✅ Mock DOM testing confirmed
   - ✅ Configuration flexibility demonstrated
Replace hardcoded element IDs with configurable mappings.
- Create DOM adapter layer
- Configurable field mappings
- Separation of data collection from calculation

⏳ Phase 3: Event-Driven Updates - NEXT
Replace direct DOM manipulation with events.
- Event emission instead of direct DOM updates
- Observer pattern for UI updates  
- Framework-agnostic rendering
- Reactive state management
- Real-time calculation updates
